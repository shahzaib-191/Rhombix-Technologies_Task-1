# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This project demonstrates how to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices based on historical data. The implementation uses Python with libraries like TensorFlow, pandas, NumPy, and yFinance.

# Features
Historical Stock Data Retrieval: Fetch stock price data using Yahoo Finance.
Data Preprocessing: Scale data for improved model performance.
LSTM Model: Predict stock prices using a sequence of historical prices.
Visualization: Compare predicted prices with actual prices in a clear plot.
Project Structure
Jupyter Notebook: Includes all steps from data collection to prediction and visualization.
LSTM Model: Built using TensorFlow for handling time-series data effectively.
Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
How to Use
Set Stock Ticker: Update the STOCK_SYMBOL variable in the notebook with your desired stock ticker (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
Set Date Range: Modify the START_DATE and END_DATE variables for the historical data range.
Run Notebook: Execute all cells sequentially.
View Results: Observe the predicted vs actual stock price comparison plot.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook
Python Libraries:

yfinance
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tensorflow
Example
Stock Symbol: AAPL
Date Range: 2015-01-01 to 2024-01-01

Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of:

Two LSTM layers with 50 units each.
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Dense layers for output generation.
Results
The model predicts the stock price trend effectively.
Suitable for short-term forecasting using recent stock price patterns.
Future Improvements
Add support for multiple stocks in one run.
Implement hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
Incorporate external factors (e.g., news sentiment, financial indicators) for enhanced predictions.
